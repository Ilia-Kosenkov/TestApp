# Cron-like scheduler
This test project is an attempt to provide a better implementation for the problem presented & discussed on [habr](https://habr.com/en/post/571342/).

According to the article, the problem was part of the job interview. The interviewer, however, rejected the implementation of the original author.
Here I make an attempt at my own solution (partially inspired by discussion on [habr](https://habr.com/en/post/571342/)). 
Both original author's and my implementations are tested against the same set of test cases (provided by the interviewer, as far as I understand).
